INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

To install the applications COLDWAVE and ERGO for windows on 
your harddrive:

1)      Copy the executables COLDWAVE.EXE and ERGO.EXE found in 
	their respective directories on the floppy disk, to an 
	appropriate directory on your hard drive.

	From within windows open the FileManager.  From within 
	file manager chose Window/New Window from the menu.  
	Select the harddrive for one window and the floppy drive 
	for the other.  Create an new directory, eg Plasma, on 
	your hard-drive by choosing File/Create Directory from 
	the menu and and entering an appropriate path such as 
	C:\PLASMA.  Then either run the File/Copy command or drag 
	the file icons from the floppy drive to the hard drive.  
	You may also wish to copy over the two documentation files
	ERGO.WRI and COLDWAVE.WRI (they are in WRITE.EXE format).
	
2)      Create a Program Manager  Group

	Choose the menu item File/New and check the New Group radio 
	button.  Enter a name for the new group and hit <Enter>.  
	A new open folder will appear in the Program Manager.  To 
	add the two programs two the group, drag them from the 
	filemanager to the program manager folder.  Alternatively, 
	Use the File/New command again, this time checking the New 
	Item radio button, and then enter the full path names to 
	the programs, eg:  C:\PLASMA\ERGO.EXE and press <ENTER> .

3)      Run the programs

	You may now run the programs by double clicking on their 
	icons in the Program Manager.  They may also be run directly
	from the floppy disk by using  the File/Run command in 
	Program Manager and entering the pathname for the program, 
	eg: B:\COLDWAVE\COLDWAVE.EXE<ENTER>, or by double clicking 
	on their icon in the FileManager listing of the floppy's 
	contents.

4)      Source Code

	Included within each directory (Ergo and Coldwave) are 
	sub-directories named 'Source' these contain the source code for 
	each program. This source code is not necessary for running 
	the program but is included to allow the experienced user
	to modify the codes or examine the algorithms used.
